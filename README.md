## 🤷‍♂️ What is EDS Retail?

EDS Retail is a free and open source retail system for small / medium-sized businesses.
The goal is to deliver a full-blown retail management system, free and open source.

Running a business is expensive enough, a retail system shouldn't be

## 🛠 Why build it?

At my first job, I worked as a sales rep and support technician for a retail/ERP system. 

Although the ERP system was pretty decent, I saw many businesses walk away from a digital system to manage their retail because of price. But, even the businesses that bought the system always had complaints / special needs / requests for features or changes.

As a software developer, I wished the company that created the application would make it open source or allow the public to contribute. I knew that I would be able to improve the application to cater for our clients if I could only access the code, but alas, the application has always been kept closed source.

Since my first few weeks at that job, I've always thought about building a free and open source retail system. Something for the little guys starting out or the shops that need some help from technology but can't afford it. Even the bigger guys who have needs that no out of box application can meet, a retail system for all...
